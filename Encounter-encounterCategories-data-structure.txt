# Using npc as an example

Map.points[(101,101)].pointCategories['npc'].LinkedListQueue

Encounter.encounterCategories['npc'].LinkedListQueue

Person.encounter['npc']

# Encounter.encounterCategories['npc'] could point to Map.points[(101,101)].pointCategoriesObj['npc']
# So when an npc is defeated it'll be removed from Encounter and Map with one operation
# Otherwise keep them separate and just do two operations every time there is a removal
# Update: I am pointing the encounter to the mapPoint LinkedList. Still have to extensively test this to ensure functionality.
